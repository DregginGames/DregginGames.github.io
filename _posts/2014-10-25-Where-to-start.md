title: So. Where to start?
---

Hello people!

So. I want to make a game, and lets assume the only thing i am able to do is Programming. Meh. So, uhh, where should i start?

I pushed away my thinking that to create a game i need an engine ready. Or anything. I want to create someting thats existence is not only based on code.
So i started collectig Ideas. 

At first, i had only this stuff in my mind: I want dragons, i want explainable magic and i want RPG.
From there i started thinking of the world. How many continents are there? How do they look like? What makes them special?
