title: So. Where to start?
---

Hello people!

So. I want to make a game, and lets assume the only thing I am able to do is Programming. Meh. So, uhh, where should I start?

I pushed away my thinking that to create a game I need an engine ready. Or anything. I want to create something that's existence is not only based on code.
So I started collecting Ideas. 

At first, I had only this stuff in my mind: I want dragons, I want explainable magic and I want RPG.
From there I started thinking of the world. How many continents are there? How do they look like? What makes them special?
My ideas ended up in three continents.
* **Parn**
    * Cold. Ice and Mountains in the north, many volcanoes (especially in the western areas). 
    * Nice infrastructure in the southern areas. The more you go north, the more paces become unreachable
    * People live in average-size cities. If you know Germany, think of something like Brunswick.
    * You wont enter this place until the end of the game. Cause here all the final stuff will happen.
* **Nep**
    * Warm. Think of Europe.
    * The beginning of the story will take place here.
    * Framing and Technology exist. Both a lot. People like using their Tablets why shaving their sheep.
    * The people really, deeply, HATE changes.
    * People live in cities (the big ones). If not, in villages. There is not a lot of stuff between these two states.
* **Farn**
    * The treeish continent. Trees everywhere. And forest. And animals. And uhh... People, too
    * People are friendly (mostly)
    * Infrastructure is MEH. Everything is connected, yes.... You should like walking.
    * A big and important part of the story will be here.
    * In the middle of this continent there is a HUGE mountain. That mountain was a volcano btw.

So now I have a basically structure where stuff will happen. Of course, there aren't any cities yet, but that will be added soon. 
A more important point at this is, in my opinion, how are these continents related to each other? Is there war? My ideas:
* The continents are independent
* There IS a worldwide government, but its not fully in charge
* Islands are not independent. 
* If there is nothing important (EBOLAAA!!!!), traveling between continents and cities etc. Is possible without major problems

A last thing I want to add here is how Magic will work in the world I'm creating. 
The word Magic should be removed. Why? Magic is something you barely can explain, that has some sort of a mystical source. What I want to be the magic, is more like... Energy. So that's what I will call it. **Energy**
How does it work? First, forget what you call physics. This is a fictional world, so its unimportant how it is in our world.
Everything is filled with Energy. Its everywhere, like air, but on a much more general scale. Like Atoms, but that they are also surrounded by Energy. So energy. And it can't be used, cause its in a stable state.
If you now start i.e burning coal, this energy around it becomes unstable. With special crystals you not could force this unstable energy in some kind of cords (like electricity), to heat water, ...
That's how it will work. And how will control it? Normally they don't. 
The Character will be one of a few humans in the world that found out he/she can use the unstable energy in the body (you know, food gets burned!) and learns how to control it.

That's it for now. I hope my randomness does not kill you and you got a small view of what I did in my brain when I started working on this project. 3 days ago. 

If you want to see the development of my ideas (and you understand German *sorry*), look [here](HTTPS://github.com/DregginGames/Ideas)
I'll raw-dump everything in this repo.
