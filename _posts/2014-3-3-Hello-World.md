title: I AM UP AND RUNNING - Welcome to my devblog
---

I want to say Welcome! This is my little blog.

What i will do in the future is, basically, writing stuff on how i create games. Or better: a game. For now.

My intention behind this is that i have alot of ideas, and well, when i try to get one thing done i end up exploding everything nothing works and i throw away a lot of stuff.

So i start this blog. I have this idea for a game, and will take me with you on my way to finish this. 
There will be ups and downs, i will have times where i will be silent. But, i promise, i will finish what i begin. This time, and every time from now. 

So welcome to my little blog :D
