title: Nearly one month silence
---

Uhh. So there was nearly a month silence. Sorry for that. I only thought about stuff id like to see, played around with Unreal 4 and literaly got NOTHING done.
School ate me, other stuff ate me and i nearly forgot about this on one day (or week?).

And now i wonder what comes next. What should i do? I have to create a Roadmap, I think. The way stuff looks like atm is that i dump ideas in my notes in school, and well, nothing actually happens.

You can expect more posts in the next days or weeks and Ill try to post once or twice a week. And ill try to get some Stuff done. 

So yeah. See ya!
