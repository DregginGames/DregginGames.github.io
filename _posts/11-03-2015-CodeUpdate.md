### Hi again!
What happend so far? Good question. 
I am close to the beginning of my finals, so i shouldt have any time for programming and desinging. 

So i wrote some code and worked on desing ideas.

### HoardXML
Lets begin with the software. I needed things (and i still need things) that do general work. Like parsing XML. 
And as I looked at the XML-parsers out there, i decided that it would be faster to write one then to learn one. 
The result is HoardXML! https://github.com/mkatle666/HoardXML

Then you would ask: what do you need an XML parser for? 
Well, I need a gui, so i save layout int there, Also its a useable way to store EVERYTHING so it makes the ResourceManager-class a lot easyer (as soon as I find time to implement it...)

### TailTipUI
That brings me to the next thing. GUI. How should i draw fancy text boxes, buttons and everything without using a huge, strangely licensed and for me unknown library?
I mean.. I do know the WinAPI, i could lern QT quickly but... its not what i want. I want to LEARN how to create GUIs. So I'm writing a library for it, too!
Its called TailTipUI https://github.com/mkatle666/TailTipUI

So thats what I did beside learning for my finals the past weeks and months. 

Next week/post I'll talk about how TailTipUI works. Really. I'll not wait another two months. I just need another weekend to fix the stuff i want to talk about!
