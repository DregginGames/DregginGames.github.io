title: Trello Roadmap Magic
---

You might now the classical desing of a whiteboard. 

You also might now these huge 4 meter long giant planning magical whiteboards. 

These don't fit in any of my rooms, but I REALLY feel the need of those. 10 of them. 
So uh, I moved to Trello. Its a giant whiteboard. I don't want to advertise here, so I'll just paste the link

[https://trello.com/b/pVcRbD3d/dreggin-games-organisation](https://trello.com/b/pVcRbD3d/dreggin-games-organisation)

Here we go. Its readable (\*cough\* and commentable \*cough\*) for everyone, so take a look. If you want to contribute, mail me.

As you can see under "General", you will notice that There WILL be a Roadmap in text form (although Trello does really well) and there WILL be a Desing Document.
So stay tunded!
