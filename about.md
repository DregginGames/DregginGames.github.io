Hello People!

Who i am you ask? My Name is Malte "mkalte" Kie√üling. I am a highschool student from Germany, and am currently in my final year (and pretty scared due to the fact ill write my Abitur in less then a year o.O)

### More Information

So what should you know about me?
I started programming when I was 10, trying to lern C++. As i failed (what could possibly go wrong!!) i restarted my lerning with HTML, PHP, ... and teached myself the basic stuff i needed. 

And then, well, i played a video game. Thats where it all began. 
A few years later i regularry wrote 1 or 2 Months on a game until throwing it all away and starting with a new one. 
Actually, i only saved one of this evil things from destruction. 
You can find it on my Github by the title "SpaceFD-47". 
Idea was a 2D shooter, but i stopped working on it because of different reasons.
Now im here...
If you have questions, ask. See Below :D

Oh one more thing: Please dont judge me by searching for grammer- and spelling mistakes. Im from germany and never was good in formal english. But if you really want to rant about it, if it is a heavy problem for you, you could pay me extra english classes :P
